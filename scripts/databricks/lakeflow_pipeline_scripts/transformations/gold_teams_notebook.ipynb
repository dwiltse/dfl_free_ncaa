    "- Performance tuning required\n",

    "### ✅ APPLY CHANGES INTO (2 lines of code)\n",
    "- 🚀 Declarative syntax\n",
    "- ⚡ Automatic change detection  \n",
    "- 🛠️ Built-in SCD management\n",
    "- 🎉 Zero maintenance required\n",

    "1. **Bronze**: `teams_raw` (streaming table) - Raw JSON ingestion\n",
    "2. **Silver**: `teams_cleaned` (streaming table) - Cleaned and flattened *(required for APPLY CHANGES INTO)*\n",
    "3. **Gold**: `dim_team` (materialized view) - Current state dimension\n",
    "4. **Gold**: `dim_team_scd` (APPLY CHANGES INTO) - Historical SCD Type 2\n",
